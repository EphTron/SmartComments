I'm upset though because they don't tell you the glue is instant. I mean, as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied, it bonds and there is no repositioning it. So I have puckered edges to my tear now. Puckered under so its not like I can trim off the edges. Hopefully I can make it look better with the repair compound.

The two-inch square of leather that comes with the kit was wildly short of what I needed. My dog is big with long (Borzoi) claws. She ripped the 'heck' out of our leather sofa, and it was jagged and loooong. Hidden under a blanket, I didn't find it in time, and when I did, my eyes bulged out of my head and I passed out. It was about 10 jagged inches and in multiple pieces.I got a large piece of leather from the local craft store and cut it to fit under each ripped section. Then carefully added a dot of glue every few inches and held it in place. The tears were severe enough that I couldn't get the edges to join, so I pulled them as close together as I could, and held it there while the glue dried. It dries quickly and was pretty secure in about 15 minutes. This left a gully between sections--not perfect, but I kept going. I was lucky in that the brown colored compound matched the sofa and I didn't need to mix colors. So they I took that little pot of brown and puttied up the whole dang thing--I filled in the gully, smoothed and let it all dry. It worked!!! I still tuck a heavy blanket over the sofa, but I keep checking to see if the repair is holding, and it is. It's been about a month, and if you didn't know the area had been ripped you might not even see the repair. I saved the rest for the next dog-claw booboo."

It took some time, and a bit of experimenting with mixing the colors to match the sofa, but if you follow the instructions you can get good results. I had two tears, one was actually a section the size of a nickle that was torn out. I was able to use the supplied backing materiel and glue the torn out piece back in place. I cleaned and trimmed the edges of the hole and used the sandpaper to prep the area. I followed the guidelines for color mixing and started with the white and added 2 drops of brown and one of yellow. The first application of the liquid was a bit to bright when it dried, so I added a bit more brown and did another application, the color matched almost perfectly. Some of the smaller repairs are invisible, the torn out piece isn't perfect, but that is due to a missed piece of fabric and it got stuck in the repair.Good results are possible, you just have to take your time and do the prep work and spend time matching the color."
"31","XX","B0002Q6362","5.0","4","4","April 11, 2013","A23RR27PIQYT8Z","Great product","I purchased this because it got good reviews - at least, good compared to other leather repair products.I uploaded pictures. The tear in my sofa was about 3 inches long. The repair fabric that was included in the kit was a great size. The included glue worked great. The instructions were very clear when it came to repairs, so it was very easy to use. I used the brown patch without mixing it, and I believe it matched very well. When I first put it on... not so much. Check out the pictures - it looked like a poop brown. However, it darkens a LOT when it dries. I used 3 coats. They dry very quickly, and I did all three coats, plus all the prep work and gluing (the patch under the tear) in one night. After over a few months, it still looks great, even with daily use (and the occasional coach surfer).The patch is there is you look for it, but seriously, this product is more than I could have ever hoped for. There is plenty of leftovers in the kit, so if I get scratches or another tear, I still have enough product to fix it. The texture isn't perfect - the patch is very smooth - but it holds up very well. I also purchased a couch cover, which (no doubt) helps with wear-and-tear, but considering the size of the tear, I'm VERY impressed with this product.The kit:Tons of colors, and everything you need to fix 3-4 inches worth of leather tear. The instructions for mending are very good, but the instructions for color mixing... very in-depth. However, my general &#34;brown&#34; leather coach matched the brown color well - as I've seen in other reviews - so I didn't even need to mix. However, I believe mixing would be easy, given the tools and instructions. Again, this product surpassed my expectations. I would not hesitate to buy from this company again."

"35","XX","B0002Q6362","4.0","8","10","March 7, 2013","A32LRAOHDQIVL7","Worked great for a major rip, just needed some creativity","I was able to repair a HUGE rip in a leather purse with this kit.  In the photos I'll add, you can see that a large piece of leather was torn almost completely away form the bottom of the purse, with frayed and scuffed spots, too.  In the end, you'd never believe it was that bad, and most of the time the repair is hardly visible except in direct light which shows it as a little bit shiny and a little less textured.The tear was so large, I improvised a bit to stabilize the fix since this was the bottom of a purse that would be carrying some heavy things at times.  First, instead of the stabilizing layer from the kit, I put a piece of flexible plastic (from a reuseable grocery bag) inside of the tear and used a heavy flexible glue (Beacon 527 glue) to adhere the really ripped-off pieces back in place, matching up edges as well as possible.I then used that same Beacon glue to fill in the smaller gaps where the leather was not ripped but gouged.  I used the leather patch from this kit according to the directions to fill in the actual holes where bits of leather had been lost around the main tear, filling in around them with glue to get everything about even and smooth.  This part took several stages, and I did it over a couple of days to allow the glue to dry before adding to it to build it up with layers.  Because I used a flexible glue, the repair is somewhat stiffer than the surrounding area, but still can flex.  This is on the bottom edge of the purse, so it didn't need to be soft anyway, but did need to be strong.Then I used the sandpaper to sand down what I'd pieced together, as instructed in the kit.  I'd recommend not sanding too far beyond the area you want to put the repair solution on- if you don't need to sand an area, leave that off til later to reduce how much solution you need to use and how much you'll be covering with it (since it did dry a little shiner- not noticeable in some lights, but more in others- better to minimize, but you can always add more later as needed).At this point, I mixed my colors.  I didn't get it quite right the first time, but that was ok for me because with the thin layers the kit recommends, I was able to spread it thinly so it mostly covered the spots that were still not filled in fully.  the narrow spatula included in the kit worked well, but there were times I used my finger to smooth out an edge very thinly, to sort of fade out the repair.  I would let it dry and make note of coloring changes I wanted, and then add the appropriate colors for the next layer to match better.  By the third layer I had a great match.  This all took another day, in stages.Also, do note that I have a good eye for color and have art experience (though the kit has a great guide for adjusting colors, which was surprisingly well-detailed).  The only disadvantage to this process of gradually finding my color was that I made sure to cover the edge of each previous layer as I added a better color, so I did cover a tiny bit more of the purse with each layer.I touched up some scuff spots and realized I might have been better off not sanding those first, since that just required more shiny repair solution in the end, when they didn't probably need sanding in the first place (the main repair definitely did).  I also used the stuff to touch up some little faded spots from normal use, which was a nice bonus.Overall, this kit was a great way to avoid replacing my favorite purse.  I still get compliments on it (granted, the repair is on the side that faces my body when I carry the bag, but people who I show it to say it's not eye-catching at all).  If you see the photos, you'll see why I thought it was a goner, and what a good job this kit did to help me put it back together.  It won't magically fix things, especially if you're not patient or crafty- but close enough for me!  There was a lot of the solution in the kit- in many colors, too- so I'll be ready next time I see a leather tear.[Now to figure out how to post photos...]"

If you follow the instructions, work in layers, and take a bit of care you'll be very happy with the outcome.The included color mixing palette is not very helpful, looks like it was printed on a color laser printer and the colors don't match reality. Even so, by first mixing brown (1/3 black, 1/3 red, 1/3 yellow) and then darkening the mix with black again, I got a near perfect match for my dark brown couch from the 1st attempt.As the title says this kit is great from small jobs (1-3 sq. inches), if your project is, lets say, brown you'll have enough for about 10 sq inches.Unless you need to fix multiple items of varying colors this is not a very cost effective solution, since you'll end up with lots of unused paint in colors you won't need.Tip: get a bottle of leather conditioner while you're at it. You will be sanding (kit includes small, but adequate sliver) and you will need some leather conditioner once you're done to restore luster to the leather."

After a lot of research, I ordered this one and I couldn't be more pleased (and relieved!!)My large dog tore an expensive leather bench with his hind claw--about a 3 inch tear with fraying.  It was pretty bad...  At first glance it looks complicated to figure out the paint mixing and all of the steps.  But after beginning the process, I realized it was super simple!  You just have to be sure to follow each step to the letter, take your time, and be patient.You begin by placing a little cloth in to the tear and gluing it together.  The mix the paint--which is really a compound that dries quickly into a leather-type filler material.  The kit includes an empty dish to mix your colors in, and keep the compound moist between coats or if you have to walk away from the project for awhile.I wound up doing about 8 coats, so the first few were perfect for simply filling in the huge tear and finding out the right color mix. I used a hair dryer in between coats so the whole project went quickly.My only advice would be this--don't sand a huge area--just sand the immediate area because whatever you sand, you will have to cover with compound.My bench looks perfect!  You can tell that it was repaired, but there is no more tear and if you were not looking for the patched area, you wouldn't see it right away.  I LOOOOOOOVE this product!!!!

Well, I mixed the color as instructed at the color guide and fine tuned the color on to my practice leather; I did the first 2 steps of on the instructions and when I spread the compound on the leather, it's too glossy and shiny, also if the colors are not 100% matched (which most likely you couldn't)it will look like a shiny middle with streaks on the outline as you fill in the fine wrinkles of the leather and shave the protruding parts.
