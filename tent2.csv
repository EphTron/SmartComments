It is the right size for one person and a pack, or two small people and no gear.The zipper broke the second night, but only along the bottom, and it was too cold for misquitos so it was a non-issue for him.  However, if you want the 'security' of having your doors zipped, be aware.The 'rain fly' is laughable.  It is about 12'x18' and JUST covers the top vents, not the whole top of the tent.  If it's raining: take a tarp, you will need it.The bottom is waterproof and did not require an additional ground cloth for our use, but it is not what one would call 'sturdy'.For a $20 tent it served it's purpose.  It is very lightweight and compact, provided minimal shelter (mostly for privacy) and is super-easy to set up.  If you are looking for a good tent to use over and over, you might want to buy higher quality, but if you need a semi-dispoable tent for a weekend or emergency, this should meet your needs."

If you want to use this tent in an area like the everglades like i did, and you don't want o be covered in bugs when you sleep, I suggest getting a bug net as well for an additional $10 and figuring out how to make that work with this tent.

Easy to set up, fit me and my gear (I went solo in the tent), and was durable. I did not experience a single problem the other reviewers had, zippers still work, mesh was small enough to keep bugs out, seams still intact, poles still in good condition. I also got it back into the carry bag with all of the poles and stakes with no issue. It was actually easier to set up than other tents my friends had with instructions included. I was done in enough time to help my friends with theirs!My 4 star review comes from this:The tent gets stuffy quick. It holds in a lot of heat, due to size. I kept the screen nets closed during the day, but the privacy screens open to let air in during the day... But no bugs. If weather permits, I'd also recommend taking the rainfly off at night, for more air circulation. I literally had condensation from my body heat on all four tent walls by morning, and I was really sweaty as well. My sleeping bag was for 40F weather. I was at the beach, and next to a lagoon. Nighttime temps were at 45F, so I should have been fairly comfortable with that combo... But it was like a sauna.My other issue is an air mattress, my friends brought me a twin to put inside... And it did not fit. Good thing I brought some thick quilts for padding, and a camping sleep mat just in case. I was still pretty comfy with those though...Overall, I'm really happy with this tent, and will be taking it on my next beach camping trips in the future! Great item for the price, and a very small package! That part was great, considering me and 3 others were carpooling together.Good product! Definitely a recommendation!"

I tried to place a double size air mattress in the tent and it would not fit, the tent was too small. Also, the support pieces that you use to anchor the tent to the ground broke off. Good tent for kids maybe, but adults beware."

I like the price, size, and shape of this tent, but it has a lot of small problems, and is honestly flimsy. its weight and pack size are excellent. it gets a little warm since the roof opening is quite small. the nettings holes are big enough to allow ants and small bugs to just crawl right in, which they did the first time i took this tent backpacking. the zipper doesnt completely close, so again bugs get in. the netting also began tearing and ripping just from the zipper opening and closing the door. ive had a lot of tents and im careful with a flimsy zipper, but the netting tearing is unavoidable. also the inside pocked it nice, but pretty low hanging if you want to use it.  all in all id say this tent is nice if you wont use it much and youre in an easy environment. if you plant to keep it a while or use it regularly this ones isnt sufficient. while being nice in size and weight its just flimsy, rips easily, and the netting is totally impractical. if they made it with just a little stronger fabric and tighter netting it would be an excellent tent."

It's easy to put together and offers plenty of space for anyone under 5'7&#34;.Unfortunately, that's not what I bought this for.  My friend and I easily fit in the tent while camping, but it didn't come with a rain tarp.  As a result, when it drizzled, we got soaking wet.Don't buy this if you're intending to go camping any farther than your back yard."

My 5 year old, 14 year old, and 70 pound German Shepherd all slept in it comfortably.  Perfect for backyard or fair weather camping.  My concerns:  poles very cheap, will probably not last too long.  Stakes are super cheap as well, so don't plan on using on rough ground."

I'm 5'7', my head and feet touched the tent as I laid, so if you are any taller, good luck !!  It was easy to put together.  One person can do it. After you remove the tent from the 'holding bag', CAN'T GET IT BACK IN !!"

There were absolutely no instructions but I had a pretty good idea how to set it up based on the photograph and how tents in general are set up. I still was unsuccessful. Also when I was feeding the poles through the yellow portion ripped. I would only recommend this tent to someone that has experience with tents or is intuitive when it comes to this type of product."

I looked at the seems and their is no way this will keep you dry. Think again before you buy this. $20.99 is too good to be true. A poncho will keep you drier. SORRY MAD I MADE THIS CHOICE!!"

Couple of things about this tent , It doesn't have a rain fly, one pocket inside, and No place to hang a light inside. Zippers could be of better quality. But for a pinch , and the price not bad. You would have better luck at big 5 looking for a sale. but look at the zippers."
