It came in extremely handy, in fact, my only regret was not having purchased on for each of my children plus myself to have one, since it is a perfect size for only one person to revel in, not more than that. This was two years ago, and I had put the fan away and just took it out again, and it still is working as it did while new.We are planning to perhaps make a trip to india again next summer, whereupon I will certainly buy at least three more of these babies, one for each child to have. The only drawback for me is that the batteries make it super heavy, at least in terms of carting across the world in the limited amount of pounds you are allowed to bring in your suitcases.

The rubber blades are perfect for preventing injury in a cramped tent. But there are many problems with this fan.1) The circular part has arms that simply plug into the base; so the fan can flop backwards and end up facing the ceiling instead of facing you. There's no way to lock it in place or tighten the grip of these arms.2) When packing the fan in a bag, the circular section will definitely come off (i.e. the arms will detach), and when this happens, the only thing holding the fan part to the base is a thin electrical cord, which will obviously break if any strain is put it on it. So this is NOT designed to be thrown in a bag, which makes no sense for a camping fan!3) I swear this thing eats batteries like they were candy.

At least not for long-term long-hour use.I initially bought this to help me sleep, I'm currently living off-grid, and since my main source of power is a generator, I obviously can't leave it going all night to power a regular fan. So I figured, hey, why not buy a battery-powered fan? Now I wasn't expecting this fans batteries to really last more than 2-3 days, but I was very surprised when this fan drained the four D batteries before my alarm even went off the next morning!Perhaps this fan is good for only occasional use, but it really didn't push much air around and it also made a strange grinding noise after only about 2 hours.All and all, not a good fan. I found a much better (and only 2 dollars more expensive) fan at walmart in the camping section which only takes two D batteries, and the battery life lasts much longer."

It was 90+ degrees the 1st night and this little fan did great. It's quiet, has 2 speeds, and takes up a small space. You really will appeciate the soft blades, as you will stick your hand into them at some point without any problems. It made hot nights quite bearable."

It is thin plastic and foam, I recommend keeping the original box to store it in while traveling,becasue it is kinda delicate.  We sat is on the fold open stool that came with the Coleman pop open table and it was at just the right height for a good night sleep in the hot tent."

I would definitely recommend buyers to purchase this fan if they are going on a camping trip.  Yes - you do have to place it close to you in order to feel the wind - but it saved me from tossing and turning all night on those windless, hot nights.  Totally worth it for the price you pay for it.  It worked so well that I am ordering a couple more for the next camping trip I take."

It's comparable to smaller desk fans in air-flow.  But unlike those fans, you can stop the 'blades' with your hand without feeling any sting, so it's safe for the tight quarters of your tent.Quibble: Since the unit is heavy already (and even includes wall-mount anchors), too bad it doesn't have dual-power-inputs for when AC power is available."

If you need some circulation this will help quite a bit.  Of course not like your box fan at home, but just enough to help."

It gives off some air, but if you are looking for a nice strong breeze this is not the fan.  It is a little fan that gives off a little breeze.  When it is hot and you do not have anything else I am sure you will be happy with it."

The humidity alone was enough to drench you with sweat.  We bought two of these fans.  One for my side of the bed, one for my husbands side.  They were perfect!  We are also noise sleepers.  We can't sleep if it is silent out.  These made just enough noise that we slept soundly.  An added plus is the fan blades are made up of foam so if you accidently bump it in the middle of the night and hit your hand on the blade, it's no pain.  Also, they fold up compactly so you can put them into a tote and go adventuring!"

But, wish it had a little more oomph.I stuck my hand in it to see if the blades stopped, or would hurt me.  There is no way anyone could get hurt.  The foam blades stop immediately.Just wonder how long the batteries will last.  Anyone know?"

It throws quite a bit of air for such a small fan and will probably be more than enough for camping near water."

They put out good air flow for the size and work well in the tent or on a table in the shelter.  My only suggested improvement would be to be able to use smaller, lighter weight batteries.  Four D cell batteries are heavy and the battery life is rather short.  But otherwise, great fans at a reasonable price!"
