It was a last minute purchase for my daughter to take camping.  It served its purpose but not sure it will be able to be used again; well possibly once more.

As a 6' adult, I had to lay diagonally in the tent, and even then I still had to curl myself slightly to fit inside.Things I really liked:- The tent arrives in a box that says &#34;Happy Tent&#34; and that's it.- There are no instructions, but if you've ever assembled any tent ever, this is easy to do.- It's a tiny tent, so it's easy to put up and take down. You don't even have to roll it, really. Just shove it in a backpack.Things I hated:- There's no UV protection. Like all cheap tents, this one acts like a greenhouse in the middle of the day. My temperature gauge said 85 degrees outside, 105 inside the tent. Yikes!- The little 12&#34;x12&#34; canopy top seems utterly useless. It doesn't fasten to anything so it flies off at the slightest breeze. WTH, guys."

It is the right size for one person and a pack, or two small people and no gear.The zipper broke the second night, but only along the bottom, and it was too cold for misquitos so it was a non-issue for him.  However, if you want the 'security' of having your doors zipped, be aware.The 'rain fly' is laughable.  It is about 12'x18' and JUST covers the top vents, not the whole top of the tent.  If it's raining: take a tarp, you will need it.The bottom is waterproof and did not require an additional ground cloth for our use, but it is not what one would call 'sturdy'.For a $20 tent it served it's purpose.  It is very lightweight and compact, provided minimal shelter (mostly for privacy) and is super-easy to set up.  If you are looking for a good tent to use over and over, you might want to buy higher quality, but if you need a semi-dispoable tent for a weekend or emergency, this should meet your needs."

If you want to use this tent in an area like the everglades like i did, and you don't want o be covered in bugs when you sleep, I suggest getting a bug net as well for an additional $10 and figuring out how to make that work with this tent.

Easy to set up, fit me and my gear (I went solo in the tent), and was durable. I did not experience a single problem the other reviewers had, zippers still work, mesh was small enough to keep bugs out, seams still intact, poles still in good condition. I also got it back into the carry bag with all of the poles and stakes with no issue. It was actually easier to set up than other tents my friends had with instructions included. I was done in enough time to help my friends with theirs!My 4 star review comes from this:The tent gets stuffy quick. It holds in a lot of heat, due to size. I kept the screen nets closed during the day, but the privacy screens open to let air in during the day... But no bugs. If weather permits, I'd also recommend taking the rainfly off at night, for more air circulation. I literally had condensation from my body heat on all four tent walls by morning, and I was really sweaty as well. My sleeping bag was for 40F weather. I was at the beach, and next to a lagoon. Nighttime temps were at 45F, so I should have been fairly comfortable with that combo... But it was like a sauna.My other issue is an air mattress, my friends brought me a twin to put inside... And it did not fit. Good thing I brought some thick quilts for padding, and a camping sleep mat just in case. I was still pretty comfy with those though...Overall, I'm really happy with this tent, and will be taking it on my next beach camping trips in the future! Great item for the price, and a very small package! That part was great, considering me and 3 others were carpooling together.Good product! Definitely a recommendation!"

I only paid $20, it' s easy to set up, light weight, stores easy & comes with stakes BUT I would not recommend this to be used for actual outdoors in the wilderness camping. Its cheaply made, the material is super thin (thinner than any tent we've camped it & we camp a lot) so I doubt it would keep any type of weather out & the door flaps dont even zip across the bottom at the floor so you can't close it up but the door netting screens do zip along the floor but the holes in the net are big so mosquitos could easily get it.

I wouldn't recommend it routine camping though.  It is cheaply made, and the  rain cover wouldn't work.  Even though I was a real camping Girl Scout for 10 years, I can't roll it up small enough to get it in the bag."

We got a puppy like 2 weeks after receiving the tent, now my puppy thinks it is his vacation home. I'm not much of an outdoorsy person but I would trust this tent on a camping trip. It zips completely up and the floor of the tent is made with plastic so I know I would not get wet. Overall, this tent has served its purpose."

They put it up in the house and slept in it 1 night before the top part that the poles connected to broke.  My sister said it was very cheaply made - wouldn't advise it to anyone!  By the way - I never write reviews - but for warning anyone who might wonder about this item!"
