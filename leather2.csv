This product worked great and came with everything I needed to repair these unsightly imperfections. I was really worried about getting the color right since my dinning room chairs are a teal color. I mixed the green leather paint with a touch of black and the color came out perfect! If your leather furniture is damaged, this is the answer to your problem!"

I'm upset though because they don't tell you the glue is instant. I mean, as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied, it bonds and there is no repositioning it. So I have puckered edges to my tear now. Puckered under so its not like I can trim off the edges. Hopefully I can make it look better with the repair compound. But if you get this know that the glue is absolutely instant! This should have made a great repair but because of the glue's properties it now looks pretty bad."

Gives about a 2' x 2' patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath.  You use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole (needing at least 1/2' overlap in each direction.  You cut the leather to fit the hole & thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth (I haven't tried tho). The hardest part is mixing the paint to match.  They have instructions for basic colors (ex: tan), but to get it to be the color you want is not for the faint of heart.  They might say, mix orange, yellow, white and brown.  Add more brown if this, add more yellow if this.  I sort of wish they'd show shades and give ratios to mix."

You can still tell it's a repair if you look, but it's not noticeable at all. The color mix directions are easy enough, the tricky part was cutting/shaping and installing the sub-patch. Tip: with the light sanding, stay within 1/4' to 1/2' from the tear. Any further will be mard to mask with the filler and could end up having noticeably less sheen that the repaired area and original leather. Overall great product."

I got a bid of $150 to get fixed professionally, and just thought I could save some money and do it myself.Some hints:-Put it on in several thin coats- I was able to get a pretty close match in color (as the directions state make it a wee bit lighter because it gets darker when it dries- don't sweat this though, if you don't have the color right, you can get it right with your second coat.)-Be careful with the sand paper- this is really what made a smallish area into a bigger repair then it needed to be.  Directions state to sand around the area- this removes the color of the leather requiring you to creep out further then you would like to.The rip is sealed now, and I have no doubt that it is sealed for good.  I can still see the line of the rip through the repair and kind of a clumpy hard rubbery patch sitting on top of it now.  I really am a glass half full kind of gal, but hindsight leaves me wishing that I had spent the $150 on a professional repair.  It is what it is."

It's against the manufacturer.Don't waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it. That's what I have and this was a waste of money. I would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch, bigger than what I have. The patching pieces (sub-material and the leather) were just too big to fit into the holes I have.So now I'm just using the glue to see if I can glue the rips shut.Unfortunately, I really thought this would be a better product, based on the price compared to other similar products."

I spent good money on them originally, and I hated to have to go shopping to try to replace them. The issue is the wear and tear my dog (yellow lab) and my cat (siamese) have caused in the last 4 years. Leather is great with pets because it cleans so easily, but the pet claws eventually wear grooves into the leather.This stuff fills them in like plastic wood does for wood. The color matching is the hard part, but with patience I got a perfect match. I applied it with a makeup brush (eyeshadow brush to be exact) and then I dabbed off the excess with my fingertip. That set it with a natural dull texture like the original finish. The stuff dries quickly and came off my hands like a second skin peeling off, no mess whatsoever. I've done the ottoman so far with fantastic results, the repairs are almost invisible. I'll take before and after pictures of the couch and chair and add them to this review soon.Great product! This is going to save my furniture ;-)"

Matching the exact 'red' of the booth seemed easy enough, however, when I came back to work on it again, the color didn't match as well as it seemed originally.  Also, use the sandpaper very sparingly.  I think the repair would have looked more inconspicuous had I not used the sandpaper at all.  In Leather Magic's defense....I have little patience for this kind of thing and it probably takes more time to really get it right."

They are black, so I didn't have to worry about color mixing. The first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried. It was very shiny, like patent leather. So my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots! The second thing to go wrong was when I cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework. Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started. The worst thing I can say is I wasted my money on this product. I definitely wouldn't recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture!"

That application worked much better. Overall, the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips.

I wouldn't expect the repair to be completely unnoticeable. Using that standard, I've given this five stars.Positives:*The instructions are EXCELLENT, particularly the very detailed color mixing instructions.*Plenty of colors of compound are provided, ensuring that the correct color can be mixed. Also I will be able to use this kit again if necessary (though I'll need to provide my own patch next time.)*The materials are easy to work with if directions are followed.Now, this doesn't look perfect on my leather chair. We had a large rip (about 4 inches.) I can see where the rip is. But our chair is a burgundy textured leather. Neither the color nor the texture is uniform, so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather. But it looks pretty good, certainly way better than a rip. It's not immediately noticeable if you're not looking for it.For the price (I paid about $25), this is a fantastic way to repair leather at home.I've uploaded some photos of the repair."

I was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair, and I think this repair won't be noticeable, as the damage is lower on a chair leg. Take the time to mix the color to match the leather, do the repairs in daylight, and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying, and it works pretty well!"

We had a 2' tear in our dark brown leather couch which looked bad and also concerned us that it would only get worse.  Initial estimates to repair it professionally were looking at $200-400 in our area so now I am looking at do I just replace the couch.  I went ahead with buying this product knowing that it could only get worse but was very happy with the end result.  The mending went very well and the color fill blended in nearly perfect.  The work is not prefect though.  We can tell where the tear was and my skills at mending and filling are meek but if you did not know that there was a tear there before, 95% would never know.  I also repaired my Mountaineer leather seat which had a 3' cut.  Again the mend went well but the color on the light grey was harder to match.  Again, way better than before and bottom line both cut's are secure and no longer at risk at getting worse.

The two-inch square of leather that comes with the kit was wildly short of what I needed. My dog is big with long (Borzoi) claws. She ripped the 'heck' out of our leather sofa, and it was jagged and loooong. Hidden under a blanket, I didn't find it in time, and when I did, my eyes bulged out of my head and I passed out. It was about 10 jagged inches and in multiple pieces.I got a large piece of leather from the local craft store and cut it to fit under each ripped section. Then carefully added a dot of glue every few inches and held it in place. The tears were severe enough that I couldn't get the edges to join, so I pulled them as close together as I could, and held it there while the glue dried. It dries quickly and was pretty secure in about 15 minutes. This left a gully between sections--not perfect, but I kept going. I was lucky in that the brown colored compound matched the sofa and I didn't need to mix colors. So they I took that little pot of brown and puttied up the whole dang thing--I filled in the gully, smoothed and let it all dry. It worked!!! I still tuck a heavy blanket over the sofa, but I keep checking to see if the repair is holding, and it is. It's been about a month, and if you didn't know the area had been ripped you might not even see the repair. I saved the rest for the next dog-claw booboo."

They said I could send it back to re-tint.I said I'd have to pay to ship it and since they couldn't get it right the first time,I'd rather just get my money back. I was told I have to pay to ship it back anyway.So I said then I'll ship it back for a re-tint, I suppose they'll want another material sample?She said just send it back and we'll refund because it doesn't sound like we'll be able to please you.I said, oh, I send a sample, you guys don't match it and I'm the problem?????So I disputed the charge with my credit card company.My suggestion it to find someone else."

It really needs to be reupholstered, but I don't have the funds for that right now.  I bought this kit instead for a fix.I was super worried about using it because I'm not a DIY person and had never done a repair like this, but the instructions were so simple and the patch looks good.  I'm not going to lie and say it isn't noticeable, but compared to the hole that was there before - this is a dream!"

If you follow the instructions, work in layers, and take a bit of care you'll be very happy with the outcome.The included color mixing palette is not very helpful, looks like it was printed on a color laser printer and the colors don't match reality. Even so, by first mixing brown (1/3 black, 1/3 red, 1/3 yellow) and then darkening the mix with black again, I got a near perfect match for my dark brown couch from the 1st attempt.As the title says this kit is great from small jobs (1-3 sq. inches), if your project is, lets say, brown you'll have enough for about 10 sq inches.Unless you need to fix multiple items of varying colors this is not a very cost effective solution, since you'll end up with lots of unused paint in colors you won't need.Tip: get a bottle of leather conditioner while you're at it. You will be sanding (kit includes small, but adequate sliver) and you will need some leather conditioner once you're done to restore luster to the leather."

After a lot of research, I ordered this one and I couldn't be more pleased (and relieved!!)My large dog tore an expensive leather bench with his hind claw--about a 3 inch tear with fraying.  It was pretty bad...  At first glance it looks complicated to figure out the paint mixing and all of the steps.  But after beginning the process, I realized it was super simple!  You just have to be sure to follow each step to the letter, take your time, and be patient.You begin by placing a little cloth in to the tear and gluing it together.  The mix the paint--which is really a compound that dries quickly into a leather-type filler material.  The kit includes an empty dish to mix your colors in, and keep the compound moist between coats or if you have to walk away from the project for awhile.I wound up doing about 8 coats, so the first few were perfect for simply filling in the huge tear and finding out the right color mix. I used a hair dryer in between coats so the whole project went quickly.My only advice would be this--don't sand a huge area--just sand the immediate area because whatever you sand, you will have to cover with compound.My bench looks perfect!  You can tell that it was repaired, but there is no more tear and if you were not looking for the patched area, you wouldn't see it right away.  I LOOOOOOOVE this product!!!!  Don't be afraid to try it-it seriously can save a piece of furniture!!!"

They are very brief and didnt have any clue how to properly put in the last step; which is the gloss. Then there's the different colors that was on a tub that looked like no more than 1 and one half of table spoon each.  Well, I mixed the color as instructed at the color guide and fine tuned the color on to my practice leather; I did the first 2 steps of on the instructions and when I spread the compound on the leather, it's too glossy and shiny, also if the colors are not 100% matched (which most likely you couldn't)it will look like a shiny middle with streaks on the outline as you fill in the fine wrinkles of the leather and shave the protruding parts. There's no way you to copy the texture of the leather around the repaired area unless the you plan to cover the whole pannel, which is again not possible since you only have a little more than a table spoon of paint!Negatives: -expensive -hard to use -limited instructions on the kit -repair will obviously look amateur-ish -Not so leather magicPositives: -It's one thing you could put on your 'NEVER buy list.'Do yourself a favor and never bother with this product; saves you the headache."
